                        Instructions:
                        1. Identify Product Categories: Determine the product categories. For example, "permanent markers", "loose-leaf-binder-paper","bed frames", etc.
                        2. Define Aspects: Determine the specific aspects or characteristics that you want to include for each product category. Aspects could be things like "Ink Longevity," "Paper Quality", "Tear line", etc. Dont include these Aspects: "Warranty and Support", "Price and Value".
                        3. Create Positive Taglines: Think of positive taglines that describe each aspect in a favorable light. These taglines should highlight the positive attributes of the product category for each aspect.For example, "Praised the paper quality","Appreciated the ink absorption","Liked the quantity per pack".It should start with words like:"Appreciated" , "Liked" , "Found" , "Praised" etc
                        4. Create Mixed Taglines: Develop mixed taglines that acknowledge both positive and negative aspects of each category. These taglines should reflect both the strengths and weaknesses of the product category for each aspect. For example, "{X} praised the paper quality, but {Y} thought it was too thin","{X} appreciated the ink absorption, but {Y} encountered issues", "{X} liked the hole strength, but {Y} found it insufficient".
                        5. Include Synonyms: Provide synonyms for each aspect to enhance understanding and clarity. Synonyms could be alternative terms or phrases that convey the same meaning as the aspect. For example, "Paper Quality" could also be referred to as "Texture" or "Thickness".
                        6. Create the json: Organize all the information into a structured json format. Include keys for the category slug, aspects, positive taglines, mixed taglines, and synonyms.
